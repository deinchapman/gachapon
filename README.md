# I've been watching videos and saw this tutorial for creating a slot machine that has help learn more how to read code and work on object oriented programming on python.
tho, i want to personalize it to make ii feel like a gacha game (I've played a lot of genshin impact). 

When that happens i'll create a new branch. I now that the process of trying to change everything to make it my style is going to make me understand further more everything i've been doing so far
at the tutorial i've watched to do this.
